# Dog-Breed-Recognition
This dog breed recognition GUI and AI developed and created with Python to study and learn creating Artifical Intellegence with Python and Tensorflow.

# about
**AI**: I have used the Tensorflow library to create an AI (keras) model trained on 120 dog breeds (10,222 images).
I got the images from [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) - Though I had to resort to using a python script to get the images as I couldn't download it by regular means. For the recognition of knowing if the image is a dog or not, I used the anomaly detection method to create `.npy` files of the anomaly of the training images, which can then be used in production.

**GUI**: For the GUI, I decided to use [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) as I really like the modernization style to it.

# Installation 
The following libraries that will be required to be installed to run this code:
- customtkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
